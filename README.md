# Diseases Prediction

In the current project, we have created an easy-to-use app with the library tkinter, that tries to predict the following diseases:

1. Breast Cancer
2. Heart Disease
3. Diabetes

In addition, there is also a prediction based on the symptoms entered by the user. Apparently, there are a lot of improvements that could be made.
